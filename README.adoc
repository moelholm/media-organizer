# Guide for developers
Before you begin: Ensure that you have jdk 11 in the path.

## Run the application
`./gradlew bootRun -Drun.arguments="--fromDir=/path/to/source --toDir=/path/to/destination"`

You can also run the application with the `--daemon` flag. It will:
- Start the application as a daemon (running until explicitly closed)
- Schedule the organizing process to run according to whatever has been configured in `application.properties` (see the application sources for examples).  
 
Do you want to try out the tool with Dropbox? Then:
- Use the `--Dfilesystemtype=dropbox` flag
- And set the System property `-Ddropbox.accessToken=[your-own-token]`.

( to use this feature you need to get your own token for your Dropbox account )
 
## Test
`./gradlew test`
( Runs all unit tests and integration tests )

## Build distribution
`./gradlew assemble`
( Find a fat JAR in the target folder )
